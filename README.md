The boom of AI-powered content generation and increasing interest in the research field of Deep Learning has led to widely accessible (and trending) tools that can produce content of any kind: text, image, audio, and video. While AI isn't new, the the availability of powerful low-code generative AI applications to the public is. AI-generated content can often be indistinguishable from its authentic counterparts, posing a threat to the credibility of digital media. The underlying dangers of the misuse of GenAI have already come to surface with deepfakes, voice cloning, fakes news, disinformation, identity theft and various types of scams. In fact, a survey conducted by Microsoft in 2023 shows that 71% of respondents are worried about AI scams.

In this project, we focus on image generation, which can have multiple societal effects, especially on people not familiar with this kind of technology. Our task is to train a neural network to identify whether an image is real or AI-generated.
